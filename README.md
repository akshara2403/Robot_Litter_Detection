# Robot_Litter_Detection

Trash deposits in environments have a destructive effect on marine ecosystems and pose a long-term economic and environmental threat. Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) such as robots could very well contribute to the solution of this problem by finding and eventually removing trash. Our project evaluates the usage of sensors and robotic components performing the task of visually detecting trash in realistic environments, with the eventual goal of exploration, mapping, and extraction of such debris by using robots. The increasing problem of litter in public spaces has led to the development of robotic sensors that can detect and remove litter efficiently. These sensors use various technologies such as cameras, AI, machine learning, and other sensors to identify different types of litter and collect it for proper disposal. The use of robotic sensors for litter detection offers several advantages such as increased efficiency, the ability to cover large areas quickly, and the ability to collect data on litter patterns, which can help inform waste management policies. However, there are also challenges associated with the use of these sensors, including the cost of development and deployment, the accuracy of litter identification, and potential job displacement concerns. Despite these challenges, robotic litter detection systems have the potential to significantly improve public health and environmental sustainability, making them a promising area of research and development.
